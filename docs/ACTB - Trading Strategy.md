  #### **3\. Strategy Components**

  ##### **3.1 Market and Asset Selection**

  ##### **3.2 Entry Rules**

**Indicators:**

* RSI (Relative Strength Index)  
* ATR (Average True Range)  
* 50-MA (50-period Moving Average)

**Conditions for Entry:**

* **Catch the Wave (Trending Markets):**

  * Enter **long** when price pulls back to **50-MA** in an uptrend, RSI is oversold, and thereâ€™s bullish candlestick confirmation.  
  * Focus on **BTC (1H)** and **SOL (1H)** for this strategy.  
* **Stuck in a Box (Range Markets):**

  * Enter **long** when price nears support (Box Bottom) with rejection patterns (e.g., hammer, doji) and RSI confirms bullish momentum.  
  * Focus on **SOL (1H, 4H)** and **ETH (4H)**.

  ##### **3.3 Exit Rules**

**Take Profit:**

* "Catch the Wave:" Exit near the **previous swing high** or when price shows RSI overbought signals.  
* "Stuck in a Box:" Exit near the **Box Top**.

**Stop Loss:**

* Use **ATR-based dynamic stop-losses** to adjust for volatility.  
* Set stop-loss below support for "Stuck in a Box" or below the 50-MA for "Catch the Wave."

  ##### **3.4 Risk Management**

**Risk per Trade:**

* Risk **1% per trade** for ETH and BTC to mitigate drawdowns.  
* Risk **2% per trade** for SOL to leverage its higher profitability.

**Position Sizing Formula:**  
 \\text{Position Size} \= \\frac{\\text{Account Balance} \\times \\text{Risk %}}{\\text{Entry Price \- Stop Loss Price}}
