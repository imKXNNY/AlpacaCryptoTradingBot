## Overview

**Crypto Trading Bot** aims to generate consistent profits through disciplined swing trading in cryptocurrency markets. Leveraging the Alpaca API and a suite of Python-based tools, the bot focuses on high-probability setups optimized through backtesting and robust risk management.

---

## Goals

### Short-Term Goals

- **Implement Strategies**: Develop and backtest strategies for each cryptocurrency pair and timeframe.
- **Achieve Win Rate**: Target a realistic win rate of 50-60% based on backtesting results.

### Long-Term Goals

- **Confidence Building**: Gain confidence in trading specific setups for each asset.
- **Capital Scaling**: Gradually increase trading capital after demonstrating consistent profitability with SOL/USDT and BTC/USDT on the 1H timeframe.

---

## Trading Strategy

### Market and Asset Selection

**Primary Market**: Cryptocurrency

**Target Assets**:

- **BTC (Bitcoin)**: Focus on the 1H timeframe using the "Catch the Wave" strategy.
- **ETH (Ethereum)**: Utilize the 4H timeframe with the "Stuck in a Box" strategy.
- **SOL (Solana)**: Apply both "Catch the Wave" and "Stuck in a Box" strategies across 1H and 4H timeframes.

**Timeframes**:

- **1-Hour (1H)**: Precision entries for BTC and SOL.
- **4-Hour (4H)**: Mid-term swing trades for ETH and SOL.
- **Daily (D1)**: Long-term support/resistance analysis (no active trading based on backtest results).

### Entry Rules

**Indicators**:

- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
- **ATR (Average True Range)**
- **50-MA (50-period Moving Average)**

**Conditions for Entry**:

#### Catch the Wave (Trending Markets)

- **Entry**: Enter a long position when:
  - Price pulls back to the 50-MA in an uptrend.
  - RSI is oversold (<30).
  - Bullish candlestick confirmation (e.g., hammer, engulfing pattern).

- **Focus**: BTC (1H) and SOL (1H).

#### Stuck in a Box (Range Markets)

- **Entry**: Enter a long position when:
  - Price nears the support zone (Box Bottom).
  - Bullish reversal patterns are identified (e.g., hammer, doji).
  - RSI confirms bullish momentum.

- **Focus**: SOL (1H, 4H) and ETH (4H).

### Exit Rules

**Take Profit**:

- **Catch the Wave**: Exit near the previous swing high or when RSI indicates overbought conditions (>70).
- **Stuck in a Box**: Exit near the range top (resistance level).

**Stop Loss**:

- **ATR-Based**: Implement dynamic stop-losses based on ATR to adjust for volatility.
  - **Catch the Wave**: Set stop-loss below the 50-MA.
  - **Stuck in a Box**: Set stop-loss below the support level.

---

## Risk Management

**Risk per Trade**:

- **ETH and BTC**: Risk 1% of account balance per trade.
- **SOL**: Risk 2% of account balance per trade due to higher profitability.

**Position Sizing Formula**:

\[
\text{Position Size} = \frac{\text{Account Balance} \times \text{Risk \%}}{\text{Entry Price} - \text{Stop Loss Price}}
\]

---

## Backtesting and Validation

### Backtesting Plan

- **Focus Pairs/Timeframes**:
  - BTC/USDT (1H)
  - SOL/USDT (1H & 4H)
  - ETH/USDT (4H)

- **Strategy Optimization**:
  - Test high-probability setups to avoid overfitting.

### Metrics to Track

- **Net Profit and Win Rate**: Prioritize for SOL and BTC.
- **Risk/Reward Ratio**: Maintain an average R:R of 1.5 or greater.
- **Drawdowns**: Keep drawdowns below 5% to mitigate significant losses.

### Analysis

- Use backtest findings to refine stop-loss and take-profit levels dynamically based on ATR.

---

## Implementation Plan

### Daily Routine

- **Morning**:
  - Check news affecting BTC, ETH, SOL.
  - Analyze 1H and 4H charts for potential setups.

- **Trading Session**:
  - Execute trades strictly based on predefined rules for BTC (1H), ETH (4H), and SOL (1H & 4H).
  - Utilize TradingView alerts to monitor key levels and confirm entries.

- **Evening**:
  - Review trades and update the trading journal.

### Weekly Routine

- **Performance Review**:
  - Evaluate win rate and profitability by asset and timeframe.
  
- **Strategy Refinement**:
  - For BTC/USDT, prioritize "Catch the Wave" on 1H.
  - For SOL/USDT, focus on both "Stuck in a Box" (4H) and "Catch the Wave" (1H).
  - Revisit ETH trading only if market conditions improve significantly.

---

## Tools and Resources

# Getting Started

To help you get started quickly, follow these steps to set up your development environment and begin implementing your trading bot.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

    cd trading-bot
    ```

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment**

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Alpaca API credentials:

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: How do I add a new trading strategy?**

*Answer*: Create a new Python script in the `src/strategies/` directory, implement your strategy logic, and write corresponding tests in the `tests/` directory.

**Q2: How can I monitor the bot's performance?**

*Answer*: Use the Streamlit dashboard located in the `streamlit_app/` directory to visualize open trades, PnL, and other performance metrics in real-time.

**Q3: Can I use this bot for live trading?**

*Answer*: Yes, once thoroughly backtested and paper-traded, you can configure the bot for live trading using Alpacaâ€™s live trading API. Ensure you understand the risks and have proper safeguards in place.

---

# Troubleshooting

**Issue**: `403 Forbidden` error when fetching crypto data.

*Solution*: Ensure you have the correct Alpaca subscription for crypto data. Use the `get_crypto_bars` method with proper symbol formatting (`"BTC/USD"` instead of `"BTCUSD"`).

**Issue**: Test failures due to mismatched DataFrame structures.

*Solution*: Align your mock data structure with the real Alpaca API responses. Ensure MultiIndex is correctly mocked in tests.
